					<p>Great read from USA TODAY Sports.</p>
					<p>From the article:</p>
					<p>&ldquo;It was a ceremony that smacked of ancient Greece, part of the eternal pageantry of the Olympics. Yet just as not all was as it seemed at the lighting &mdash; the high priestess was actually a Greek actress &mdash; neither does the torch relay represent the Games&rsquo; origins.</p>
					<p>&ldquo;It was, in fact, invented by the Nazis.&rdquo;</p>

					<p>Exhibit page by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum</p>
					<p>&ldquo;Hitler initially held the Olympics in low regard because of their internationalism, but he became an avid supporter after Joseph Goebbels, his Minister of Propaganda, convinced him of their propaganda value. The regime provided full financial support for the event.&rdquo;</p>

					<p>Article published by the Journal of Olympic History, hosted by the LA84 Foundation</p>
					<p>&ldquo;Carl Diem was probably the most significant German sports official as a source of ideas, as organizer and researcher. He was respected, admired, but he was always also a controversial figure.&rdquo;</p>
					<p><strong><a href="http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/NASSH_Proceedings/NP1996/NP1996zw.pdf">Carl Diem and the Denazification of German Sport</a></strong></p>
					<p>Essay by United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, hosted by the LA84 Foundation</p>
					<p>&ldquo;Yet despite Diem's ideological position, the 1936 Games evidenced an unprecedented fusion of sports and politics. Diem's enormous organizational talent and scholarly knowledge of the Olympic movement was co-opted by the Nazi propaganda machine, which took full credit for the success of the 1936 Games. Moreover, Diem's denial of</p>
					<p>Nazi intentions in 1936 is contrasted by his later role in defending one of the final bastions of Nazi resistance against the Soviet conquest of Berlin. In early 1945, as Hitler Youth prepared for the armed defence of the Olympic Stadium and the Reich sportfeld, Diem delivered a passionate speech to these young men in order to lift their morale for the final cataclysmic battle.&rdquo;</p>

					<p>Comprehensive history book about the 1936 Games by <a href="http://ies.berkeley.edu/david-clay-large">David Clay Large</a>, a history professor at University of California, Berkeley.</p>
					<p>&ldquo;The torch relay―that staple of Olympic pageantry―first opened the summer games in 1936 in Berlin. Proposed by the Nazi Propaganda Ministry, the relay was to carry the symbolism of a new Germany across its route through southeastern and central Europe. Soon after the Wehrmacht would march in jackboots over the same terrain.&rdquo;</p>
					<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Story-Olympic-Torch-Philip-Barker/dp/144560180X">The Story of the Olympic Torch</a></strong></p>
					<p>History book about the Olympic torch by <a href="http://isoh.org/staff-view/philip-barker-gbr/">Philip Barker</a>.</p>
					<p>&ldquo;Passed from hand to hand, the Olympic flame has become one of the great symbols of sport. The relay from the ruins at Olympia in Greece forges a powerful bond with the Ancient Olympic Games. Using original documents, The Story of the Olympic Torch chronicles the development of the run as the first great event of the Games. It describes the symbolism as the spark is kindled from the rays of the sun in Olympia at the start of the journey. It reveals the obstacles faced by organisers in 1948 before the flame could be brought to London. It explains why three Olympic torch relays were organised in 1956, and the many original ways the flame has been transported, from under the ocean to the highest mountain. The lighting of the cauldron is the final dramatic moment of an opening ceremony, but it is by no means the oldest part of the Olympic ritual. Barker explores the importance of music and the five Olympic Rings. Tables detail the facts and figures of each relay and for the first time list every runner to have carried the torch on British soil and the main stopping points of the route for 2012. The roll of honour also includes those who have taken the Olympic Oath.&rdquo;</p>
